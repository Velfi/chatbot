# TODO

- Save old conversations to a SQLite database.
  - I think this is complete but I need to test with a real conversation
- Replace some `unwrap`s and `expect`s with `Result`s.
- Fix presentation of the conversation so that it wraps
- enable scrolling of the conversation
- write readme explaining how to setup and use the app
  - Add more detail to the costs section
- add clap app + arguments
